```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Feedback loop to avoid unintended consequence of your decisions.

- Example CLD - work productivity
- Group model building (book with exercise)

```{r}
## compute tables of correlations
library(LoopAnalyst)
data(cm.levins)
cem <- make.cem(cm.levins)
cem.corr(cem)

```

Conclusion:
Another more understandable way of presenting the relationships between mutiple variables.
